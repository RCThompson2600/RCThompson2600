### Hello there, I'm Robert. ðŸ‘‹

### Who I am and What I do
I am a mechanical engineer, and an engineering management student, always looking to pick up new skills and lean new things.  I love to solve puzzles/problems and make new things.  I am currently learing about the world of data science, and data visualization.  In my spare time I like to play classical guitar. ðŸŽ¸
